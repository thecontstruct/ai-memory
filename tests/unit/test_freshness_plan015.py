"""WP-8 tests: Freshness Injection Gate — collection targeting fixes (PLAN-015 §WP-8).

1. build_ground_truth_map() queries COLLECTION_GITHUB (not COLLECTION_DISCUSSIONS)
2. build_ground_truth_map() does NOT include source='github' filter
3. count_commits_for_file() queries COLLECTION_GITHUB (not COLLECTION_DISCUSSIONS)
4. count_commits_for_file() does NOT include source='github' filter
5. sync() runs freshness scan after sync cycle
6. sync() does NOT propagate exceptions from run_freshness_scan()
