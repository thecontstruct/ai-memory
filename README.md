## 🧬 Bespoke Neural Memory

<table>
<tr>
<td width="60%">

**This isn't a database you configure. It's institutional memory that forms as you build.**

Traditional knowledge bases require upfront schema design and manual curation. AI-Memory takes a different approach: let the LLM and human decide what matters, and capture it as it happens.

> 🎯 Error fixed? **Captured.**
> 📐 Architecture decision made? **Stored.**
> 📏 Convention established? **Remembered.**

**Your agents don't just execute—they learn.**

</td>
<td width="40%">

| | Aspect | Benefit |
|:--:|--------|---------|
| 🎨 | **Bespoke** | Memory unique to YOUR project |
| ⚡ | **JIT Creation** | Emerges from work, not config |
| 💫 | **Transient → Persistent** | Sessions become knowledge |
| 🪶 | **Token Efficient** | ~500 token focused memories |
| 🚀 | **Lightweight** | Docker + Qdrant + Python |

## Parzival: AI Project Manager

Parzival is your AI project manager for Claude Code. He manages your project from first idea through production and beyond — planning the work, activating parallel agent teams, reviewing all output adversarially, and maintaining the project for its lifetime. You talk to Parzival. Parzival manages everything else.

**Full project lifecycle:**

- **Init (new project)**: Parzival walks you through setting up goals, scope, and oversight structure from scratch
- **Init (existing project)**: Parzival audits what exists — code, docs, planning artifacts — and establishes oversight around it
- **Discovery**: Analyst researches, PM produces a validated PRD with your sign-off
- **Architecture**: Architect designs the system, PM breaks it into epics and stories, Architect confirms readiness
- **Planning**: Scrum Master initializes sprints and creates implementation-ready story files
- **Execution**: DEV implements, DEV code-reviews, Parzival loops until zero legitimate issues, you approve
- **Integration**: Full test plan, cohesion check, all modules verified together
- **Release**: Changelog, rollback plan, deployment verification, your sign-off
- **Maintenance**: Bug fixes, new features, tech debt — Parzival triages, dispatches, and verifies for the life of the project

**How it works:**

1. You describe what needs doing
2. Parzival reads your architecture, PRD, and standards before making any recommendation
3. Parzival activates parallel agent teams via Claude Code teams, giving each agent precise, file-referenced instructions
4. Parzival reviews all agent output adversarially before presenting results to you
5. Review, fix, review continues until zero issues remain, then you approve

**Dispatch skills:**

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Team Builder** | Designs parallel agent teams (2-tier or 3-tier) based on work complexity, assigns ownership, avoids file conflicts |
| **Agent Dispatch** | Prepares agent instructions and handles activation (Layer 3a, steps 1-3 of the 9-step pipeline) |
| **Agent Lifecycle** | Manages the running agent — send, monitor, review, accept/loop, shutdown, summary (steps 4-9) |
| **BMAD Dispatch** | Selects the right specialized agent for each task (Analyst, PM, Architect, DEV, Scrum Master, UX Designer) |
| **Model Dispatch** | Optional multi-provider LLM routing (Claude, Ollama, OpenRouter) based on task complexity and agent role |

See [docs/DISPATCH-SKILLS.md](docs/DISPATCH-SKILLS.md) for setup and usage of the dispatch skill suite.

**The core principle: Parzival recommends. You decide.** Parzival is the navigator — you are the captain. He plans, delegates, and verifies. He never writes code, never makes final decisions without your approval, and a 20-constraint enforcement system prevents behavioral drift across long sessions.

Parzival is optional but highly recommended — he enables cross-session agent memory, full project lifecycle management, and the quality enforcement that keeps complex multi-session projects on track. AI Memory's core features (semantic search, GitHub sync, skills, freshness detection) work independently, but Parzival is where the system reaches its full potential. To start: `/pov:parzival`

See [docs/parzival/](docs/parzival/) for the full documentation suite and [docs/DISPATCH-SKILLS.md](docs/DISPATCH-SKILLS.md) for multi-provider dispatch setup.

## 🏆 What No Other Tool Has

AI-Memory combines capabilities that exist nowhere else as a single integrated system:

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| **Semantic Decay Scoring** | Memories age naturally via exponential decay — recent patterns rank higher than stale ones, automatically |
| **Cross-Session Memory** | Qdrant vector search resurfaces exactly the right context at session start, without you asking |
| **3-Layer Security Pipeline** | PII and secrets screened via regex + detect-secrets + SpaCy NER before any content is stored |
| **GitHub History → Semantic Search** | PRs, issues, commits, CI results, code blobs, diffs, reviews, and releases searchable by meaning |
| **Freshness Detection** | Stale code-pattern memories flagged automatically by comparing stored patterns against current git state (3/10/25 commit thresholds) |
| **Dual Embedding Routing** | Code uses `jina-v2-base-code`; prose uses `jina-v2-base-en` — 10-30% better retrieval accuracy |
| **Progressive Context Injection** | Token-budget-aware 3-tier delivery: session bootstrap, per-turn injection, confidence-filtered retrieval |

## 🕰️ V2.0.6 — Temporal Memory

v2.0.6 adds the **WHEN dimension** — your memories now understand time, freshness, and relevance decay.

- ⏳ **Semantic Decay Scoring**: Older memories naturally lose relevance via exponential decay with type-specific half-lives (code: 14d, discussions: 21d, conventions: 60d)
- 🔄 **GitHub History Sync**: Ingest PRs, issues, commits, CI results, and code blobs from your GitHub repo into the memory system
- 🛡️ **Security Scanning Pipeline**: 3-layer PII and secrets detection (regex + detect-secrets + SpaCy NER) runs before any content is stored
- 🎯 **Progressive Context Injection**: Smart 3-tier context delivery — session bootstrap, per-turn injection, and confidence-filtered retrieval
- 🔍 **Freshness Detection**: Automatically identifies stale memories by comparing against current git state
- 🔐 **SOPS+age Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive configuration with modern age encryption

## 🔭 V2.0.7 — LLM Observability

v2.0.7 adds **Langfuse LLM observability** (opt-in, entirely optional) — full pipeline tracing so you can see exactly what your memory system is doing.

- **🔭 9-Step Pipeline Tracing**: Every hook span (`1_capture` through `9_classify`) is traced and visible in Langfuse with latency, inputs, and outputs
- **📊 Session Grouping**: Traces are grouped by Claude Code session ID, so you can follow an entire conversation's memory operations as a single thread
- **🛡️ Kill-Switch Control**: `LANGFUSE_ENABLED=true|false` turns all tracing on/off with zero code changes — hooks remain <500ms even when tracing is active
- **💾 File-Based Buffer**: Trace events are written to disk (~5ms overhead) and flushed to Langfuse asynchronously by a dedicated worker — no SDK dependency in hook scripts
- **🏷️ Custom Model Registration**: Ollama, OpenRouter, and other LLM providers registered as custom models for cost tracking
- **👥 Multi-Project Isolation**: Each project's traces are tagged with `project_id` (from `group_id`), keeping observability data separated
- **📈 Grafana Integration**: Langfuse-specific Grafana panels for buffer depth, flush latency, and trace throughput alongside existing memory metrics
- **🐳 7 New Services**: Langfuse Web UI, Worker, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, MinIO, and Trace Flush Worker — all opt-in via `--profile langfuse`

See [docs/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION.md](docs/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION.md) for setup and architecture guide.

## 🔗 Jira Cloud Integration

Bring your work context into semantic memory with built-in Jira Cloud support:

- **Semantic Search**: Search Jira issues and comments by meaning, not just keywords
- **Full & Incremental Sync**: Initial backfill or fast daily updates via JQL
- **ADF Conversion**: Atlassian Document Format → plain text for accurate embeddings
- **Rich Filtering**: Search by project, issue type, status, priority, or author
- **Issue Lookup**: Retrieve complete issue context (issue + all comments, chronologically)
- **Dedicated Collection**: `jira-data` collection keeps Jira content separate from code memory
- **Tenant Isolation**: `group_id` based on Jira instance hostname prevents cross-instance leakage
- **Two Skills**: `/aim-jira-sync` for synchronization, `/aim-jira-search` for semantic search

See [docs/JIRA-INTEGRATION.md](docs/JIRA-INTEGRATION.md) for setup and usage guide.

---

## 🐙 GitHub Integration

Bring your repository history into semantic memory with built-in GitHub support:

- **Semantic Search**: Search PRs, issues, commits, CI results, and code blobs by meaning, not keywords
- **9 Content Types**: `github_pr`, `github_issue`, `github_commit`, `github_ci_result`, `github_code_blob`, `github_pr_diff`, `github_pr_review`, `github_issue_comment`, `github_release`
- **Full & Incremental Sync**: First run backfills full history; subsequent runs fetch only new or updated items
- **AST-Aware Code Chunking**: Code blobs are split at AST boundaries (functions, classes), not arbitrary character offsets
- **Freshness Feedback Loop**: Merged PRs automatically flag stale code-pattern memories for review
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Reads `X-RateLimit-Remaining` response headers and backs off automatically
- **Two Skills**: `/aim-github-sync` for synchronization, `/aim-github-search` for semantic search

See [docs/GITHUB-INTEGRATION.md](docs/GITHUB-INTEGRATION.md) for setup and usage guide.

## 🔭 Langfuse LLM Observability (Optional)

> **Note**: Langfuse is entirely optional. AI Memory works fully without it. Enable only if you want LLM pipeline tracing. See [docs/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION.md](docs/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION.md) for setup.

Opt-in LLM observability powered by [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) — trace every memory operation from hook execution through classification:

- **9-Step Pipeline Spans**: `1_capture`, `2_log`, `3_detect`, `4_scan`, `5_chunk`, `6_embed`, `7_store`, `8_enqueue`, `9_classify` — each emitted as a Langfuse span with timing and payload data
- **Session-Based Traces**: Traces are grouped by Claude Code session ID via Langfuse sessions, so you can follow all memory operations for a single conversation
- **File Buffer Architecture**: Hook scripts write JSON events to `trace_buffer/` (~5ms per event). A dedicated `trace-flush-worker` container reads and batches events to Langfuse every 5 seconds
- **Kill-Switch**: `LANGFUSE_ENABLED=false` disables all trace emission globally. Per-hook control via `LANGFUSE_TRACE_HOOKS=false`
- **Buffer Eviction**: Oldest trace files are automatically evicted when the buffer exceeds `LANGFUSE_TRACE_BUFFER_MAX_MB` (default: 100 MB)
- **Custom Model Tracking**: `ollama/*`, `openrouter/*`, and `openrouter/*:free` registered as custom models for provider-aware cost analysis

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Run Langfuse setup (generates secrets, starts services, registers models)
./scripts/langfuse_setup.sh

# Enable tracing in your .env
echo "LANGFUSE_ENABLED=true" >> docker/.env

# Start all services (including Langfuse, since LANGFUSE_ENABLED=true)
./scripts/stack.sh start

# Open Langfuse UI
open http://localhost:23100
```

See [docs/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION.md](docs/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION.md) for complete setup, architecture, and troubleshooting guide.

## ⚖️ Evaluation Pipeline (LLM-as-Judge)

Automated quality evaluation using LLM judges — measure how well the memory system is actually performing, not just whether it runs:

- **6 built-in evaluators**: Retrieval relevance, injection value, capture completeness, classification accuracy, bootstrap quality, and session coherence
- **Multi-provider support**: Ollama (default — local and free), OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Golden datasets**: 5 curated datasets (123 items) covering key system behaviors for repeatable regression benchmarking
- **CI quality gate**: GitHub Actions workflow blocks PRs if evaluation scores regress below defined thresholds
- **Zero-secret config**: All settings in `evaluator_config.yaml`; credentials via environment variables only

Configure via `evaluator_config.yaml`. Run with `python scripts/run_evaluations.py --config evaluator_config.yaml`.

---

## 🔬 Knowledge Discovery

### Best Practices Researcher

When you ask "how should I..." or "what's the best way to...", AI-Memory's best-practices-researcher activates:

1. **Search Local Knowledge** - Checks the conventions collection first
2. **Web Research** - Searches 2024-2026 sources if needed
3. **Save Findings** - Stores to `oversight/knowledge/best-practices/BP-XXX.md`
4. **Database Storage** - Adds to Qdrant for future retrieval
5. **Skill Evaluation** - Determines if findings warrant a reusable skill

### Skill Creator Agent

When research reveals a repeatable process, the skill-creator agent can generate a Claude Code skill:

```
User: "Research best practices for writing commit messages"
→ Best Practices Researcher finds patterns
→ Evaluates: "This is a repeatable process with clear steps"
→ User confirms: "Yes, create a skill"
→ Skill Creator generates .claude/skills/writing-commits/SKILL.md
```

**The Result:** Your AI agents continuously discover and codify knowledge into reusable skills.

**v2.0.6 additions**: GitHub sync service ingests repository data (PRs, issues, commits, code blobs) into the dedicated `github` collection. A 3-layer security scanning pipeline (regex + detect-secrets + SpaCy NER) screens all content before storage. Semantic decay scoring applies time-weighted relevance to all search queries. The Parzival session agent stores cross-session memory in the discussions collection for project continuity.

**v2.0.7 additions**: Langfuse LLM observability stack provides full pipeline tracing. Hook scripts emit trace events to a file-based buffer (`trace_buffer.py`), and a dedicated flush worker (`trace_flush_worker.py`) batches events to Langfuse via the SDK. All 9 pipeline steps are instrumented as spans, grouped by session ID. The classifier worker emits `9_classify` spans with provider, confidence, and reclassification outcome.

### Collection Structure

| Collection | Purpose | Example Types |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **code-patterns** | HOW things are built | implementation, error_pattern, file_pattern, refactor |
| **conventions** | WHAT rules to follow | rule, guideline, naming, structure |
| **discussions** | WHY things were decided | decision, session, preference, user_message, agent_response, blocker |
| **github** | WHEN things changed | github_pr, github_issue, github_commit, github_ci_result, github_code_blob |
| **jira-data** | External work items from Jira Cloud | jira_issue, jira_comment |

> **Note:** The `jira-data` collection is conditional — it is only created when Jira sync is enabled (`JIRA_SYNC_ENABLED=true`).

### Automatic Triggers

The memory system automatically retrieves relevant context:

- **Error Detection**: When a command fails, retrieves past error fixes
- **New File Creation**: Retrieves naming conventions and structure patterns
- **First Edit**: Retrieves file-specific patterns on first modification
- **Decision Keywords**: "Why did we..." triggers decision memory retrieval
- **Best Practices Keywords**: "How should I..." triggers convention retrieval
- **Session History Keywords**: "What have we done..." triggers session summary retrieval

### Trigger Keyword Reference

The following keywords automatically activate memory retrieval when detected in your prompts:

<details>
<summary><b>Decision Keywords</b> (20 patterns) → Searches <code>discussions</code> for past decisions</summary>

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| Decision recall | `why did we`, `why do we`, `what was decided`, `what did we decide` |
| Memory recall | `remember when`, `remember the decision`, `remember what`, `remember how`, `do you remember`, `recall when`, `recall the`, `recall how` |
| Session references | `last session`, `previous session`, `earlier we`, `before we`, `previously`, `last time we`, `what did we do`, `where did we leave off` |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Session History Keywords</b> (16 patterns) → Searches <code>discussions</code> for session summaries</summary>

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| Project status | `what have we done`, `what did we work on`, `project status`, `where were we`, `what's the status` |
| Continuation | `continue from`, `pick up where`, `continue where` |
| Remaining work | `what's left to do`, `remaining work`, `what's next for`, `what's next on`, `what's next in the`, `next steps`, `todo`, `tasks remaining` |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Best Practices Keywords</b> (27 patterns) → Searches <code>conventions</code> for guidelines</summary>

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| Standards | `best practice`, `best practices`, `coding standard`, `coding standards`, `convention`, `conventions for` |
| Patterns | `what's the pattern`, `what is the pattern`, `naming convention`, `style guide` |
| Guidance | `how should i`, `how do i`, `what's the right way`, `what is the right way` |
| Research | `research the pattern`, `research best practice`, `look up`, `find out about`, `what do the docs say` |
| Recommendations | `should i use`, `what's recommended`, `what is recommended`, `recommended approach`, `preferred approach`, `preferred way`, `industry standard`, `common pattern` |

</details>

> **Note**: Keywords are case-insensitive. Only structured patterns trigger retrieval to avoid false positives on casual conversation.

### LLM Memory Classifier

The optional LLM Classifier automatically reclassifies captured memories into more precise types:

- **Rule-based first**: Fast pattern matching (free, <10ms)
- **LLM fallback**: AI classification when rules don't match
- **Provider chain**: Primary provider with automatic fallback

**Quick Setup:**

```bash
# Configure in docker/.env
MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_ENABLED=true
MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_PRIMARY_PROVIDER=ollama    # or: openrouter, claude, openai
MEMORY_CLASSIFIER_FALLBACK_PROVIDERS=openrouter

# For Ollama (free, local)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=sam860/LFM2:2.6b

# For OpenRouter (free tier available)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemma-2-9b-it:free
```

See [docs/llm-classifier.md](docs/llm-classifier.md) for complete setup guide, provider options, and troubleshooting.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Services

```bash
# Recommended: use the unified stack manager
./scripts/stack.sh start    # Start all services (reads .env for profile selection)
./scripts/stack.sh status   # Check health
./scripts/stack.sh stop     # Graceful shutdown
```

Alternatively, using Docker Compose directly:

```bash
# Core services (Qdrant + Embedding)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# With monitoring (adds Prometheus, Grafana, Pushgateway)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --profile monitoring up -d
```

### 2. Verify Services

```bash
# Check Qdrant (port 26350)
curl -H "api-key: $QDRANT_API_KEY" http://localhost:26350/health

# Check Embedding Service (port 28080)
curl http://localhost:28080/health

# Check Grafana (port 23000) - if monitoring enabled
open http://localhost:23000  # credentials from installation
```

### 3. Install to Project

```bash
./scripts/install.sh /path/to/your-project

# With convention seeding (recommended)
SEED_BEST_PRACTICES=true ./scripts/install.sh /path/to/your-project
```

**Expected Output:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  AI Memory Module Health Check
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[1/3] Checking Qdrant (localhost:26350)...
  ✅ Qdrant is healthy

## 💡 Usage

### 🔧 Automatic Memory Capture

Memory capture happens automatically via Claude Code hooks:

1. **SessionStart** (resume/compact only): Injects relevant memories when resuming a session or after context compaction
2. **PostToolUse**: Captures code patterns (Write/Edit/NotebookEdit tools) in background (<500ms)
3. **PreCompact**: Saves session summary before context compaction (auto or manual `/compact`)
4. **Stop**: Optional per-response cleanup

No manual intervention required - hooks handle everything.

> **The "Aha Moment"**: Claude remembers your previous sessions automatically. Start a new session and Claude will say "Welcome back! Last session we worked on..." without you reminding it.

### 🎯 Manual Memory Operations

Use slash commands for manual control:

```bash
# Check system status
/aim-status

# Manually save current session
/aim-save

# Search across all memories
/aim-search <query>

# Jira Cloud Integration (requires JIRA_SYNC_ENABLED=true)
/aim-jira-sync              # Incremental sync from Jira
/aim-jira-sync --full       # Full sync (all issues and comments)
/aim-jira-search "query"    # Semantic search across Jira content
/aim-jira-search --issue PROJ-42  # Lookup issue + all comments
```

#### v2.0.6+ Skills

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/aim-purge` | Purge old memories with dry-run safety (e.g., `--older-than 90d`) |
| `/aim-github-search` | Semantic search of GitHub data (PRs, issues, commits, code) |
| `/aim-github-sync` | Manually trigger GitHub repository sync |
| `/aim-pause-updates` | Toggle automatic memory updates on/off (kill switch) |
| `/aim-refresh` | Trigger freshness scan on changed files |
| `/parzival-save-handoff` | Save Parzival session handoff to Qdrant memory |
| `/parzival-save-insight` | Save a Parzival insight for cross-session recall |
| `/aim-freshness-report` | Scan code-patterns for stale memories by comparing against current git state |

#### Upgraded Skills (v2.0.6+)

| Command | What Changed |
|---------|-------------|
| `/aim-status` | 4 new sections: decay stats, GitHub sync status, security scan summary, Parzival session info |
| `/aim-search` | Now displays decay scores alongside relevance scores |
| `/aim-save` | Supports agent memory types (handoff, insight, task) |

See [docs/HOOKS.md](docs/HOOKS.md) for hook documentation, [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md) for commands, [docs/llm-classifier.md](docs/llm-classifier.md) for LLM classifier setup, [docs/JIRA-INTEGRATION.md](docs/JIRA-INTEGRATION.md) for Jira integration guide, and [docs/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION.md](docs/LANGFUSE-INTEGRATION.md) for LLM observability setup.

### 🤖 AsyncSDKWrapper (Agent SDK Integration)

The AsyncSDKWrapper provides full async/await support for building custom Agent SDK agents with persistent memory.

**Features:**

- Full async/await support compatible with Agent SDK
- Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm (Tier 1: 50 RPM, 30K TPM)
- Exponential backoff retry with jitter (3 retries: 1s, 2s, 4s ±20%)
- Automatic conversation capture to discussions collection
- Background storage (fire-and-forget pattern)
- Prometheus metrics integration

**Basic Usage:**

```python
import asyncio
from src.memory import AsyncSDKWrapper

async def main():
    async with AsyncSDKWrapper(cwd="/path/to/project") as wrapper:
        # Send message with automatic rate limiting and retry
        result = await wrapper.send_message(
            prompt="What is async/await?",
            model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
            max_tokens=500
        )

        print(f"Response: {result['content']}")
        print(f"Session ID: {result['session_id']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Streaming Responses (Buffered):**

> **Note**: Current implementation buffers the full response for retry reliability. True progressive streaming planned for future release.

```python
async with AsyncSDKWrapper(cwd="/path/to/project") as wrapper:
    async for chunk in wrapper.send_message_buffered(
        prompt="Explain Python async",
        model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
        max_tokens=800
    ):
        print(chunk, end='', flush=True)
```

**Custom Rate Limits:**

```python
async with AsyncSDKWrapper(
    cwd="/path/to/project",
    requests_per_minute=100,   # Tier 2
    tokens_per_minute=100000   # Tier 2
) as wrapper:
    result = await wrapper.send_message("Hello!")
```

**Examples:**

- `examples/async_sdk_basic.py` - Basic async/await usage, context manager pattern, session ID logging, rate limiting demonstration
- `examples/async_sdk_streaming.py` - Streaming response handling (buffered), progressive chunk processing, retry behavior
- `examples/async_sdk_rate_limiting.py` - Custom rate limit configuration, queue depth/timeout settings, error handling for different API tiers

**Configuration:**

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable before using AsyncSDKWrapper:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
```

**Rate Limiting:**

The wrapper implements token bucket algorithm matching Anthropic's rate limits:

| Tier | Requests/Min | Tokens/Min |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Free | 5           | 10,000     |
| Tier 1 | 50 (default) | 30,000 (default) |
| Tier 2 | 100         | 100,000    |
| Tier 3+ | 1,000+      | 400,000+   |

Circuit breaker protections:
- Max queue depth: 100 requests
- Queue timeout: 60 seconds
- Raises `QueueTimeoutError` or `QueueDepthExceededError` if exceeded

**Retry Strategy:**

Automatic exponential backoff retry (DEC-029):
- Max retries: 3
- Delays: 1s, 2s, 4s (with ±20% jitter)
- Retries on: 429 (rate limit), 529 (overload), network errors
- No retry on: 4xx client errors (except 429), auth failures
- Respects `retry-after` header when provided

**Memory Capture:**

All messages are automatically captured to the `discussions` collection:
- User messages → `user_message` type
- Agent responses → `agent_response` type
- Background storage (non-blocking)
- Session-based grouping with turn numbers

See `src/memory/async_sdk_wrapper.py` for complete API documentation.

For complete design rationale, see `oversight/specs/tech-debt-035/phase-2-design.md`.

### 👥 Multi-Project Support

Memories are automatically isolated by `group_id` (derived from project directory):

```python
# Project A: group_id = "project-a"
# Project B: group_id = "project-b"
# Searches only return memories from current project
```

**V2.0 Collection Isolation:**
- **code-patterns**: Implementation patterns (per-project isolation)
- **conventions**: Coding standards and rules (shared across projects by default)
- **discussions**: Decisions, sessions, conversations (per-project isolation)
- **github**: GitHub PRs, issues, commits, CI results (per-project isolation)
- **jira-data**: Jira issues and comments (per-project isolation, conditional)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting, including:

- Services won't start
- Health check failures
- Memories not captured
- Search not working
- Performance problems
- Data persistence issues

### Recovery Script

If hooks are misbehaving (e.g., after a failed install or upgrade), use the recovery script to scan and repair all project configurations:

```bash
# Dry-run: shows what would change (safe, no modifications)
python scripts/recover_hook_guards.py

# Apply fixes across all discovered projects
python scripts/recover_hook_guards.py --apply

# Scan only: list all discovered project settings.json files
python scripts/recover_hook_guards.py --scan
```

The recovery script automatically discovers projects via:
1. `~/.ai-memory/installed_projects.json` manifest (primary)
2. Sibling directories of `AI_MEMORY_INSTALL_DIR` (fallback)
3. Common project paths (additional fallback)

It fixes: unguarded hook commands (BUG-066), broad SessionStart matchers (BUG-078), and other known configuration issues. Always run with dry-run first to review changes.

### Quick Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check all services
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps

# Check logs
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs

# Check health
python scripts/health-check.py

# Check ports
lsof -i :26350  # Qdrant
lsof -i :28080  # Embedding
lsof -i :28000  # Monitoring API
```

### Services Won't Start

**Symptom:** `docker compose up -d` fails or services exit immediately

**Solution:**

1. Check port availability:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :26350  # Qdrant
   lsof -i :28080  # Embedding
   ```

2. Check Docker logs:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs
   ```

3. Ensure Docker daemon is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps  # Should not error
   ```

### Health Check Fails

**Symptom:** `python scripts/health-check.py` shows unhealthy services

**Solution:**

1. Check service status:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps
   ```

2. Verify ports are accessible:
   ```bash
   curl -H "api-key: $QDRANT_API_KEY" http://localhost:26350/health  # Qdrant
   curl http://localhost:28080/health  # Embedding
   ```

3. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs qdrant
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs embedding
   ```

### Memories Not Captured

**Symptom:** PostToolUse hook doesn't store memories

**Solution:**

1. Check hook configuration in `.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PostToolUse": [{
         "matcher": "Write|Edit",
         "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/scripts/post_tool_capture.py"}]
       }]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Verify hook script is executable:
   ```bash
   ls -la .claude/hooks/scripts/post_tool_capture.py
   chmod +x .claude/hooks/scripts/post_tool_capture.py
   ```

3. Check hook logs (if logging enabled):
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ai-memory/logs/hook.log
   ```

For more detailed troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## 💾 Backup & Restore

Protect your AI memories with built-in backup and restore scripts.

### Quick Backup

```bash
# Setup (one-time)
cd /path/to/ai-memory
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install httpx

# Get your Qdrant API key
cat ~/.ai-memory/docker/.env | grep QDRANT_API_KEY
export QDRANT_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run backup
python scripts/backup_qdrant.py
```

Backups are stored in `backups/` directory with timestamped folders containing:

- Collection snapshots (code-patterns, conventions, discussions, github, jira-data)
- Configuration files
- Verification manifest

### Quick Restore

```bash
python scripts/restore_qdrant.py backups/2026-02-03_143052
```

See [docs/BACKUP-RESTORE.md](docs/BACKUP-RESTORE.md) for complete instructions including troubleshooting.

> **Coming soon:** Backup and restore scripts will be updated in the next version to support the `jira-data` collection, including Jira database backup and reinstall.

## 📈 Performance

### Coding Conventions

- **Python (PEP 8 Strict)**: Files `snake_case.py`, Functions `snake_case()`, Classes `PascalCase`, Constants `UPPER_SNAKE`
- **Qdrant Payload Fields**: Always `snake_case` (`content_hash`, `group_id`, `source_hook`)
- **Structured Logging**: Use `logger.info("event", extra={"key": "value"})`, never f-strings
- **Hook Exit Codes**: `0` (success), `1` (non-blocking error), `2` (blocking error - rare)
- **Graceful Degradation**: All components must fail silently - Claude works without memory
